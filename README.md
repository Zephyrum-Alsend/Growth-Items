Mod series for the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion

Mods are written in Oblivion's scripting language, which resembles C.
All actual data is stored and compiled in the .esp, the file type Oblivion uses and the Construction Set edits.
As such, all code contained within the .esp is copied to .txt files for external viewing.
Unfortunately, this means they lack all of the highlighting code files would otherwise get.

The Construction Set itself also lacks highlighting, however the Construction Set Extender adds it.
The Extender is also required to compile the .esp, as it uses many functions added by OBSE.
