-Begun work on mod
-Setting up basic growth system
-Created SetWeight
-Created SetStat
-Created SetXPReq

2020.04.14
-Created DefaultINI
-Created Object
-Had to stall work as I further mull how to implement growing damage type resistance
	-OBSE handler to get damage taken	-handler to get magic effect hit by
	-function to get if weapon ignores normal weapon resistance
	-nothing to get how much fire/frost/shock/etc. damage taken, only total
	-can get enchantment of what hit, pull magnitudes from there
	-can get resistances of player, apply to magnitudes
	-but also need difficulty setting, unknown multiplier to damage taken
	-how do I sync multiple event handlers?	-probably need another quest

2020.04.18
-Made name setting more robust by adding str_Prefix and str_Postfix along with s%Fix flags to indicate which %fix to omit
-Created SetName
-Message icon path is magenta
-GetIconPath returns ""
-GetTexturePath returns ""
-Armor has 2 icon paths, so can't resolve which
-Found GetBipodIconPath, but need to indicate which sex
-Created GetPCBIP (GetPCBipedIconPath) which returns the Male/Female path based on Player's sex
-Message icon works
-Will leave in printc's I use for testing as printd's, which won't show up without the debug flag set
-Added Debug global so can toggle printd ingame, also added to ini for diagnosing initializer problems
-Switched to DebugPrint from printd b/c printd doesn't read format strings
-Went ingame to test OnHealthDamage handler, works as expected so far, except...
	-damage over time triggers every frame, 100s of ticks from a single spell
-AR of all pieces is 1
-Turns out, despite the Object Window displaying AR as a float, it is in fact a long and 400AR = 4AR
-Converted all AR vars from floats to shorts
-Forgot to SetArmorType in SetWeight
-Seems OnMagicEffectHit is always called before OnHealthDamage
-OnMagicApply has inconsistent filtering, but with GetSelf inside, can get caster, target and spell
-OnHitWith will not fire for spells
-If I can't get the time for a DoT, can't reliably accredit elemXP to it
-DoT can come from enchant or spell, OnMagicApply or OnHitWith, conflict ho
-Maybe DoTs appear on Active Effects?
-They do!
-I can also indirectly get the magnitude, duration and caster of all Active Effects, maybe solve recalc damage formula problem?
-Instant effects don't appear on Active Effects, there goes that
-But can still do even distribution with ability to get duration on DoTs

2020.04.19
-Created LogXP and added globals for tracking combat XP, expanded OnDamage to add XP
	-Using globals because QuestID.VarName is slow, as file read/write on Dusfergon showed
-Added fDamageLag for latency control, starting DamageAnalysis quest script
-DamageAnalysis is shorter than expected, uses HasMagicEffect instead of GetActiveEffects to test for DoT
-Created OnWeaponHit to trigger physical damage type flags
-Removed OnMagicApply, unreliably fires and data unecessary in current approach
-Moved handler sets to Object
-Equipping another shield does not run OnUnEquip block for the shield, but directly unequipping it does
-Circumvented issue by using OnActorUnequip handler, may convert all On(Un)Equip blocks to this so don't have to maintain 2 Object scripts
-Converted blocks to handlers, made SetEquipHandlers to set all
-Expanded CleanUp to not only purge handlers, but re-evaluate Equip flag and reset handlers if necessary
-Learned OBSE Let supports +=, I have code to shorten!
-Created SetEquipHandlers to handle handler creation for On(Un)Equip
-Double checked and corrected documentation of existing code

2020.04.20
-Created SetResists to add resist effects to enchantments
-Started using array_vars as parameters more often, functions then support variable parameters
-Created SetEnchants to avoid typing out 6 checks and sets for enchantments
-Updated CleanUp to null array_vars when Mode is 1 and moved further up Init block
-Created SetEffectMagnitude to update Resists, but also designed to be used for any effect
-Properly adds new Resists
-Properly updates existing Resists
-Works with Fortify effects
-But with multiple Fortify effects, updating freezes game - single Fortify effect is fine
-GetNthEffectItemActorValue freezes the game

2020.04.21
-GetNthEffectItemActorValue wasn't the problem, I forgot to increment the iterator within the while loop
-SetEffectMagnitude now works for all cases, finishing documentation
-Realised I can repurpose function handle setting all stats instead of making one for each stat, so SetEffectMagnitude is now SetEffectItem
-Added conditions for deleting effect items in SetEffectItem
-List of allowable enchants, plan to be 1 by 1 instead of effect sets
	-Fortify Attribute
	-Fortify Skill
	-Fortify Health/Fatigue/Magicka
	-Shield
	-Feather
	-Restore Health/Fatigue/Magicka
-Shield exclusive enchant effects
	-Reflect Damage
	-Reflect Spell

2020.04.22
-Invetigated ways to detect application of diseases and poisons
-The best method is either to scan Active Effects list and get the sources to check for spell type or use OnMagicApply and check GetSelf == Player then spell type

2020.04.23
-OnMagicApply can detect when diseases are applied, but it's unfortunate the filtering options are subpar
-GetSelf when it fires, then do rest if Player
-Diseases are cast on the Player by the Player
-Finding an enemy who uses Poison has been harder, bandits most likely to carry and use it
-Poisons are registered as SpellType 0 (Spell) instead of 5 (Poison), cumulative poison resist is out then
-Added Drain Health to list of effects that count as non-elemental damage
-Added section to purge enchantments on game load
-Enchanted weapons do not have the ignorenormalresistance flag set, added check for enchantment in OnWeaponHit
-Applied enchantments do not take effect until the item is re-equipped
-Player.EquipItem triggers the OnEquip handler twice
-Turns out there's 2 OnEquip handlers set, now to find out where
-Somehow, SetEquipHandlers is setting 2 OnEquip handlers, despite explicitly setting only 1
-I see no syntax error in the code, and moving it to Manager did not resolve the issue
-For now, all I can do is put a check in OnEquip to prevent Equip from going over 6
-OnEquip handler runs twice for every armor except the Shield
-Tried different syntax for SetEventHandler, no difference
-May have to revert to using the actual blocks instead of handlers
-Commented out OnEquip handler, moved code to OnEquip block in Object
-After more testing, discovered OnActorEquip handler fires twice for enchanted items
-Added Resist Disease variables and globals, updated SetResists and Manager
-Created OnMagicApply to handle detection of diseases
-Changed how Paralysis and Disease resistances work so ini vars are more intuitive
	-Both resists now use sXPResist to determine resist effect
	-sXPPara now dictates how much RXP/sec paralyzed is awarded, instead of seconds paralyzed till resist effect up
	-fXPDisease used to be number of diseases caught till resist effect up, now sXPDisease and how much RXP/illness
-Created RefreshEquipped to handle re-equipping items after enchanting, can also use for form changing
