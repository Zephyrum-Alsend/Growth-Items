2020.04.13
-Begun work on mod
-Setting up basic growth system
-Created SetWeight
-Created SetStat
-Created SetXPReq

2020.04.14
-Created DefaultINI
-Created Object
-Had to stall work as I further mull how to implement growing damage type resistance
	-OBSE handler to get damage taken	-handler to get magic effect hit by
	-function to get if weapon ignores normal weapon resistance
	-nothing to get how much fire/frost/shock/etc. damage taken, only total
	-can get enchantment of what hit, pull magnitudes from there
	-can get resistances of player, apply to magnitudes
	-but also need difficulty setting, unknown multiplier to damage taken
	-how do I sync multiple event handlers?	-probably need another quest

2020.04.18
-Made name setting more robust by adding str_Prefix and str_Postfix along with s%Fix flags to indicate which %fix to omit
-Created SetName
-Message icon path is magenta
-GetIconPath returns ""
-GetTexturePath returns ""
-Armor has 2 icon paths, so can't resolve which
-Found GetBipodIconPath, but need to indicate which sex
-Created GetPCBIP (GetPCBipedIconPath) which returns the Male/Female path based on Player's sex
-Message icon works
-Will leave in printc's I use for testing as printd's, which won't show up without the debug flag set
-Added Debug global so can toggle printd ingame, also added to ini for diagnosing initializer problems
-Switched to DebugPrint from printd b/c printd doesn't read format strings
-Went ingame to test OnHealthDamage handler, works as expected so far, except...
	-damage over time triggers every frame, 100s of ticks from a single spell
-AR of all pieces is 1
-Turns out, despite the Object Window displaying AR as a float, it is in fact a long and 400AR = 4AR
-Converted all AR vars from floats to shorts
-Forgot to SetArmorType in SetWeight
-Seems OnMagicEffectHit is always called before OnHealthDamage
-OnMagicApply has inconsistent filtering, but with GetSelf inside, can get caster, target and spell
-OnHitWith will not fire for spells
-If I can't get the time for a DoT, can't reliably accredit elemXP to it
-DoT can come from enchant or spell, OnMagicApply or OnHitWith, conflict ho
-Maybe DoTs appear on Active Effects?
-They do!
-I can also indirectly get the magnitude, duration and caster of all Active Effects, maybe solve recalc damage formula problem?
-Instant effects don't appear on Active Effects, there goes that
-But can still do even distribution with ability to get duration on DoTs

2020.04.19
-Created LogXP and added globals for tracking combat XP, expanded OnDamage to add XP
	-Using globals because QuestID.VarName is slow, as file read/write on Dusfergon showed
-Added fDamageLag for latency control, starting DamageAnalysis quest script
-DamageAnalysis is shorter than expected, uses HasMagicEffect instead of GetActiveEffects to test for DoT
-Created OnWeaponHit to trigger physical damage type flags
-Removed OnMagicApply, unreliably fires and data unecessary in current approach
-Moved handler sets to Object
-Equipping another shield does not run OnUnEquip block for the shield, but directly unequipping it does
-Circumvented issue by using OnActorUnequip handler, may convert all On(Un)Equip blocks to this so don't have to maintain 2 Object scripts
-Converted blocks to handlers, made SetEquipHandlers to set all
-Expanded CleanUp to not only purge handlers, but re-evaluate Equip flag and reset handlers if necessary
-Learned OBSE Let supports +=, I have code to shorten!
-Created SetEquipHandlers to handle handler creation for On(Un)Equip
-Double checked and corrected documentation of existing code

2020.04.20
-Created SetResists to add resist effects to enchantments
-Started using array_vars as parameters more often, functions then support variable parameters
-Created SetEnchants to avoid typing out 6 checks and sets for enchantments
-Updated CleanUp to null array_vars when Mode is 1 and moved further up Init block
-Created SetEffectMagnitude to update Resists, but also designed to be used for any effect
-Properly adds new Resists
-Properly updates existing Resists
-Works with Fortify effects
-But with multiple Fortify effects, updating freezes game - single Fortify effect is fine
-GetNthEffectItemActorValue freezes the game

2020.04.21
-GetNthEffectItemActorValue wasn't the problem, I forgot to increment the iterator within the while loop
-SetEffectMagnitude now works for all cases, finishing documentation
-Realised I can repurpose function handle setting all stats instead of making one for each stat, so SetEffectMagnitude is now SetEffectItem
-Added conditions for deleting effect items in SetEffectItem
-List of allowable enchants, plan to be 1 by 1 instead of effect sets
	-Fortify Attribute
	-Fortify Skill
	-Fortify Health/Fatigue/Magicka
	-Shield
	-Feather
	-Restore Health/Fatigue/Magicka
-Shield exclusive enchant effects
	-Reflect Damage
	-Reflect Spell
	-Absorb Spell

2020.04.22
-Invetigated ways to detect application of diseases and poisons
-The best method is either to scan Active Effects list and get the sources to check for spell type or use OnMagicApply and check GetSelf == Player then spell type

2020.04.23
-OnMagicApply can detect when diseases are applied, but it's unfortunate the filtering options are subpar
-GetSelf when it fires, then do rest if Player
-Diseases are cast on the Player by the Player
-Finding an enemy who uses Poison has been harder, bandits most likely to carry and use it
-Poisons are registered as SpellType 0 (Spell) instead of 5 (Poison), cumulative poison resist is out then
-Added Drain Health to list of effects that count as non-elemental damage
-Added section to purge enchantments on game load
-Enchanted weapons do not have the ignorenormalresistance flag set, added check for enchantment in OnWeaponHit
-Applied enchantments do not take effect until the item is re-equipped
-Player.EquipItem triggers the OnEquip handler twice
-Turns out there's 2 OnEquip handlers set, now to find out where
-Somehow, SetEquipHandlers is setting 2 OnEquip handlers, despite explicitly setting only 1
-I see no syntax error in the code, and moving it to Manager did not resolve the issue
-For now, all I can do is put a check in OnEquip to prevent Equip from going over 6
-OnEquip handler runs twice for every armor except the Shield
-Tried different syntax for SetEventHandler, no difference
-May have to revert to using the actual blocks instead of handlers
-Commented out OnEquip handler, moved code to OnEquip block in Object

2020.04.24
-After more testing, discovered OnActorEquip handler fires twice for enchanted items
-Added Resist Disease variables and globals, updated SetResists and Manager
-Created OnMagicApply to handle detection of diseases
-Changed how Paralysis and Disease resistances work so ini vars are more intuitive
	-Both resists now use sXPResist to determine resist effect
	-sXPPara now dictates how much RXP/sec paralyzed is awarded, instead of seconds paralyzed till resist effect up
	-fXPDisease used to be number of diseases caught till resist effect up, now sXPDisease and how much RXP/illness
-Created RefreshEquipped to handle re-equipping items after enchanting, can also use for form changing
-Looking over Manager code, noticed did not keep header documentation up to date

2020.04.27
-Began designing SetEnchant, for setting all enchant effects on all items
-Created SetEffectStat
-Added Enchantment variables for effect magnitudes
-Added Enchantment section to DefaultINI
-Adjusted DefaultINI comments to better explain Dynamic Resistances

2020.05.02
-While I'd like to not use dot notation in creating enchantments, the idea of creating an array to house the data for hunndreds of effects and maintaining is too daunting
-dot notation is easier to code
-In order to facilitate making Dusfergon's active enchant indexing possible, created GetEffectCode to convert global short into EffectCode and ActorValueCode
-Creating 246 new globals to track enchantment levels and active enchantment for each piece, 41 globals per item
	-I considered overloading globals with multiple values, but that would reduce their individual level caps, which need to be ( sLevelCap - sEnchStart )
		-The player can pheasibly pick only one effect every Seek, having its level match the item's
-Created Body globals
-Created Foot globals
-Created Hand globals
-Created Head globals
-Created Legs globals
-Created Shld globals
-Went for an array approach afterall, to remove the need to copy&paste a giant block 6 times
-Creating the multi-dimensional array to hold all the enchant data exceeds the max script size
-Cannot make the complete array even in a separate function, MAX_SCRIPT_SIZE exceeded
-Dropping level data from array, cut down array size to 1/6, will need second array to hold level data
-Created GetEnchantLevels
-Created framework for setting leveled enchantments on items, throwing runtime errors
-Array creation was placed before CleanUp in my re-ordering then re-re-ordering of init block
-Tested Fortify Strength, Fortify Blade, Shield ingame, all work as expected
-Manager header is still not uptodate
-Reviewing during documentation process, GetEffectCode may not be necessary... Will keep it around until leveling block(s) are done
-Added XP > 0 check to DamageAnalysis to save cycles while not in combat

2020.05.03
-Updated Manager's Used Scripts and Used Globals sections
-Beginning Enchant Seek code
-SeekOnce will double as trigger flag for block and storage for button value
-SeekOnce will not double as trigger flag and button value, because page number and button value are stored in Item
-Created GetEnchChoice which houses all seek menu code
-Tested ingame for Shield, Feather, all Restores, some Fortifies - all work as expected
-Now to test if a while loop emulates the responsiveness of low script lag...
	-Freezes game
	-Infinite loop because while loop doesn't give GetButtonePressed enough time to return a value
-Finished and tested Seek code. Menus work, effects are added, variables cleaned up
	-Seek code really looks like it could be factored out into a function but... That may fuck up the menus
-RefreshEquipped is unequipping but not equipping gear after the first initialization
	-RefreshEquipped during the init phase works
	-RefreshEquipped after seek phase only unequips
-Trying adding suit of armor, unequipping armor by equipping newly added armor, then equipping old armor and removing new armor
	-Still same bug, old armor not re-equipped
-If I put a pause between the unequip and re-equip, it works
-Now to find out how short I can make that pause...
-Looks like as long as they're not done on the same frame the bug won't happen
-Created RefreshEquip
-Created RefreshUnEquip
-Created RefreshOnce flag
-Added block at bottom of Manager to refresh equipped items in a 2 frame time span, since model change will use it too

2020.05.04
-Added sEnchResist to flag if having resistances should enchant the items early
-Began work on Level Up block
-Created SetEnchLevel to increment enchant level globals
-Doing stat set instead of mod b/c it's easier, no new functions needed
-Level up armor stat block is identical to init armor stat block, should make it a function
-Created SetArmor
-Function doesn't work as long as its a function
-Exact same code (Copy&Paste) in GameMode block works as expected, factored to a function and it doesn't
	-Armor weight and stats mismatch, heavy w/ light stats or light w/ heavy stats
-SetArmor deleted

2020.05.05
-Created ModStat to replace "lazy" level up method

2020.05.08
-Created SetFlavorText for displaying all flavor text
-Found Dereference/Unbox operator ( *array ) which can replace Item["value"] in a lot of places
-Replaced all instances of array["value"] with *array where it didn't throw errors
-Created LogLevel
-Added block for Half-way messages
-Created SetFlavorBox and renamed SetFlavorText to SetFlavorMessage
-Have 3 first boot messages, 4 level up messages, 5 form change messages
-Have 6 level cap messages

2020.05.09
-Re-balanced effect growth rates
	-REDG, RFLC, SABS Mult +0.2
	-FOAT, FOSK Base +1 Mult +0.6
	-REFA Mult +0.1
	-REHE Base +1 Mult +0.025
	-RESP Mult +0.05
	-SHLD Base +3 Mult +0.7666
-Discovered AR is not updated by game until gear re-equipped, set Refresh flag in level up
-Divided level up block into 2
	-Stats update
	-Global and flag update
		-Allows Set aaZefirosLevel to X to have an immediate effect
-Included redundant flag checks into both blocks so flags are set properly regardless of level change by XP or console
-Consolidated ModStat DebugPrints into 1 line to reduce console clog on level up
-Cannot reduce DebugPrint lines further without reducing their usefulness as diagnostics
	-If wearing half set, can still see command to change aaZefirosLevel in log after level up
