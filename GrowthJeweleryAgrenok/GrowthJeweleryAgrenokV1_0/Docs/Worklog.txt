-Skimmed Zefiros's code
-Named new mod Agrenok
-Grows with magicka spent, base spell cost square rooted (or something)
-Created .esp
-Jogged memory on coding Zefiros
-Will have to do pre-coding, a lot to remember to implement
	-do NOT want a repeat of merging code

PRE-CODE (multi-day)
-Name, prefix/suffix
-Weight, value (clothing)
-Multi-slot/merging and appearance change
-Growing enchantments
-Magicka usage based XP gain (base spell cost, modified (base spell cost exponentially increases))
-Offerings, separate XP gain from durability gain...? Armor with 0 AR?
-XP reporting, debugging messages
-Mimicry

2021.04.08
-Created PsuedoCode.txt, editing in Visual Studio Code
-Mitigates need to rewrite code if I forget something important (like multi-slot items)

2021.04.22
-Added description for Related Scripts/Globals
-Scrapped idea of Restore Attribute dynamic resistance
-Since Agrenok will be merged with Zefiros+Dusfergon, using Scalar as collective variable name
-Outlined GameMode block for Main
-Outlined MenuMode block for Main
-Not sure if should implement paging for Save/Load custom sets, posed question to Nexus community
	via mod page
-Outlined Enchanting and SigilStone MenuMode blocks

-Paired Water Walking with Resist Water Damage after investigating what it does (resist lava damage)

2021.05.29
-Forgot what I planned to have as a base enchantment (since no AR as clothing)
	-Shield?
	-Multiply gold found?
	-Chance to duplicate looted items?
	-Multiply XP gain?
	-Multiply birthsign/racial bonus?
	-Multiply Active Effects?
	-Reduce durability damage?
	-Multiply enchantment effects?
	-Multiply active spell effects?
	-Reduce spell cost?
	-Allow X wishes per in-game month or 1 wish every X days or scale magnitude of effect?
	-Reduce Greater Power cooldown?
	-Increase number of Greater Power casts per cooldown period?
-Decided on Allow 1 wish per X days, magnitude of effect scales with Agrenok level
-Could be random blessings, could be a list PC chooses from
	-Random blessings are easy, no PC agency
		-Less wacky effects, since PC has little idea what effects may happen
	-PC Wishes are more work, more PC agency
		-Random list of wishes (text parser is NO)
		-More wacky effects, PC chooses them
		-Joke wishes "I wish for another wish!"
-Let PC make wishes, instead of random blessings
	-MessageBox prompt
	-Need hotkey defined (INI configurable)
	-9 buttons (1 reserved for [Cancel])
	-15+ wishes, random 9 to choose from
	-9 options cycle every 1 day (INI configurable)
	-Wish has 10 day cooldown (INI configurable)
-Possible Wish effects:
	-Gold
	-XP to random number of highest skills
	-XP to random number of lowest skills
	-XP to random skills
	-XP to random Combat/Stealth/Magic skills
	-XP to random Major skills
	-XP to random Minor skills
	-Bonus XP for X hours
	-Creatures stop being hostile for X hours
	-Cycle wishlist "I wish for another wish!"
	-Attribute/skill buffs
	-X bonus to all attributes for Y hours
	-X bonus to all skills for Y hours
	-X bonus to all attributes and skills for Y hours
	-X bonus to all major skills for Y hours
	-X bonus to all minor skills for Y hours

2021.06.05
-Renamed Related Scripts/Globals to Calling Scripts/Globals, Main has Other Scripts/Globals
-Started adding variables for each enchantment effect
-Replaced %Mult with %Incr, as Increment is more intuitive thant Multiplier considering use
-Added enchantment effect variables
-Replaced Water Breathing partner effect Fortify Athletics with Restore Fatigue and Restore Magicka
	-Effects will be triggered while underwater
	-OnWaterDive and OnWaterSurface handlers exist, huzzah
-Got the code for Resist Water Damage (RSWD)
-Changed commenting format to Construction Set standard for finished sections
-Started level up variables
	-noticed an unused variable in Zefiros, will refrain from completing until level up
	code is pseudocoded

2021.06.12
-Changed flag variable leading character to b from s
	-Even though there's no boolean type, that's how they're used and now easier to spot flags
-Debating whether to add _ to all variable leads (s_%, f_%, l_% instead of s%, f%, l%, etc.)
	-Will keep as is for now
-Keybinds section made, not populated
	-Unsure how many binds will need at this point
-Mimicry section made
	-Need to open Construction Set to see if jewelery has different paths from armor/weapons
	-Same paths
-Latency section made
-Started filling out globals
	-Decided to reorder global naming: aaScalar[Item][VarName]
-Filled out globals, put them all in Other, will move to Used as they're used
-Replaced all LRing/RRing with LRng/RRng
	-LRng/RRng in engine
	-LRing/RRing because my hands kept typing that out and I gave up correcting myself
	-but consistency is important
-Added " | %.0f" to enchantment var comments, to easily tell which effect is which ench level ID
-Reordered variable names to match global naming schema
-Started initialization block
